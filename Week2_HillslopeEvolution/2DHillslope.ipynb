        "\n",
        "Last year in Mountain Landscapes, you simulated how a simple hillslope would evolve via both linear and non-linear hillslope diffusion. You did this in 1D - you had one cross section of a hillslope. You can see how you already managed to explore a lot of interesting things about hillslope morphology from this 1D approach!\n",
        "\n",
        "But what if we're interested in how hillslopes interact with each other or with the channel network, or how morphology varies spatially? To look at that, we need to move beyond one to two dimensions - where we are simulating hillslopes in both an X and a Y dimension. To do that, we are going to use the _Landlab_ numerical model. Landlab is a piece of software that has been developed to model landscapes in Python. It is very flexible: we can choose to simulate lots of different processes all within one piece of software. You will be using Landlab later in the module to simulate channel processes as well. \n",

Restart everything, and use the model to determine how long it takes for the landscape to go from a flat to reach 50%, 75% and 100% of its steady-state morphology. Does the landscape approach steady state linearly in time? (You can run the time loop (Code Block 7) multiple times without running other code blocks again to continually evolve the landscape. You will initially want to rerun all the code blocks and change the value of **run_time** (Code Block 4). Determining the correct value of **run_time** to use will take some iteration.\n",
        "2. What do you think will happen when you increase $D$ (Code Block 3) by a factor of 10? Will the time to steady state differ? If yes, how? Will the topography be different? If yes, how and why? What does it mean physically, about processes, if $D$ increases? Answer these questions before running any code. \n",
        "3. Now set $D$ = 0.1 m$^2$yr$^{-1}$ and rerun landscape evolution from an initial flat. Illustrate the final steady state topography and record the time to steady state. Discuss how the landscape differs from the results in question 1. Discuss how the results are similar to or different from your intuition. It is OK if your intuition was wrong! \n",

If yes, how and why? Answer these questions first, and then rerun the code with **uplift_rate** = 0.001 m yr$^{-1}$. (Make sure you change $D$ - Code Block 3 - back to the original value of 0.01 m$^2$yr$^{-1}$ and restart from a flat surface.) Illustrate the final steady state topography. Discuss how these results differ from the results in question 1 and how the results match (or do not) your intuition. It is OK if your intuition was wrong.\n",
