To do this, run the main evolution loop again - Code Block 8 - and the different plotting blocks WITHOUT running the code blocks above them. (You could also change $tmax$ in Code Block 4 instead). How did you know that the landscape reached steady state? Note the approximate time that it took to reach steady state for your own reference. (This will be useful for later questions.) Include appropriate plots. (If you want to analyze these landscapes outside of Landlab or save for later, make sure you save the elevation data to a text file (Code Block 14) and the river profiles to a CSV file (Code Block 15).)\n",

        "4. **Transient landscape responding to an increase in rock uplift.** Use the base landscape and increase rock uplift uniformly by a factor of 4 to 0.0004 m/yr. Make sure you update the rock uplift rate (Code Block 7) and ensure that $tmax$ is 100,000 yrs and $dt$ is 500 yrs (Code Block 4). Once you have changed the parameters in these blocks REMEMBER TO RE-RUN THESE BLOCKS OR THE CODE WILL STILL USE THE OLD PARAMETERS. Run this until the maximum elevation in the grid is ~ 170 m (to re-run for a longer time, run Code Block 8 again) and observe how the landscape gets to this elevation, i.e. plot intermediate steps. What patterns do you see in the supporting plots that show the landscape is transient?\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Steady-state landscape with increased rock uplift.** Now keep running with the same parameters until your landscape reaches steady state (i.e. run the time loop, Code Block 8, lots more times: if you want, you can increase $tmax$ and $dt$ to make this run faster). Provide a plot that illustrates that the landscape is in steady state. What aspects of the landscape have changed in comparison with the base landscape from question 1?\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Increase erodibility.** Start again with a NEW landscape (re-run from Code Block 2). Make sure rock uplift rate is set to the original value of 0.0001 m/yr (Code Block 8). Run the landscape to steady state with the original $K_{sp}$ value of 0.00001, with $tmax$ of 1,500,000 years and $dt$ of 1,000 years. After you have reached steady state, double $K_{sp}$ to 0.00002 (Code Block 5), then change $tmax$ to 100,000 years and $dt$ to 500 years. Change $tmax$ to 100,000 years, and then run the model again a couple of times. Quantitatively describe how the landscape evolves in response to the increase in erodibility and provide supporting plots. What could cause a uniform increase in erodibility?\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Final reflections**. Were your hypotheses correct in questions 2 and 3? It's fine if they weren't - just make sure you understand how we would expect a landscape to respond to changing erodibility and uplift!"
