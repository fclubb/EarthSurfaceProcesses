    "# Analysing Hillslope Morphology at the Landscape Scale\n",
    "\n",
    "Hillslope morphology reflects the competition between surface uplift and river erosion, which sets the baselevel conditions for hillslopes. In lab 2 you ran a simple numerical model in order to explore how changes in uplift and erosion influence hillslope development. In this lab, you will look at some hillslope morphology data from a real landscape in order to try and interpret the distribution of erosion in order to infer rates of tectonic processes. The data has already been generated for you by running software developed by Hurst et al. (2012) and Grieve et al (2016) to extract information about hillslope morphology from digitial elevation models (DEMs). This software is slow and was run on a very large dataset so the results have been provided in the data download from Moodle. The aims of this lab are:\n",
    "* Follow and execute python code to analyse hillslope morphology extracted from a DEM.\n",
    "* Further understand the concept of steady-state and transience in hillslope morphology\n",
    "* Quantify metrics of dimensionless hillslope morphology\n",
    "* Analyse hillslope morphology at a landscape scale to evaluate the distribution of erosion/uplift.\n",
    "* Create and explain figures that show variation in hillslope form in a tectonically active landscape\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bolinas\n",
    "The landscape you will work on is the Bolinas Ridgeline, which runs adjacent to the San Andreas Fault in California, just north of San Francisco, over the Golden Gate Bridge. You will analyse hillslope morphology in 40 catchments along the fault that drain towards the fault. These catchments are of similar size, but relatively small, no more than  ~4 km in length. The elevation of the landscape generally increases from NW to SE.\n",
    "\n",
    "![title](images/basemap.png \"ShowMyImage\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The bedrock beneath these catchments is uniform, consisting of poorly-consolidated metasedimentary rocks (sandstones) of the Franciscan Fm. The key point here is that there should be little variation in channel or hillslope form due to differences in bedrock type. The hillslopes here are all soil-mantled, and thus you can assume transport-limited conditions and that the nonlinear sediment flux law is appropriate to govern downslope soil flux on the hillslopes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previous work by Kirby et al (2007) has examined the morphology of the river profiles and found that rivers get progressively steeper, with increasing $M_{\\chi}$ from NW to SE. The parameter $M_{\\chi}$ is an estimate of channel slope normalised to drainage area, and is considered a good proxy for erosion rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "![title](images/chi_steepness_map.png \"ShowMyImage\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Kirby et al (2007) suggested that channel erosion rates increased from NW to SE and thus inferred that there was an increase in tectonic uplift rate along this landform. This is important because the high uplift rates make this site a potential nucleus for future earthquakes and San Francisco has a prominent history of being hit by large earthquakes. Millions of people live in the Bay Area, which also has one of the USA's biggest ports, and there is a great deal of industry near by from hi-tech manufacturing to financial services. We will explore whether hillslope morphology reflects the patterns of erosion inferred from the channel network.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python\n",
    "The programming language we are using in this lab is called Python.  No prior knowledge of programming is required for this lab. Learning how to be a programmer is not the aim! However, this sort of scientific computing is becoming more common place in research and consultancy, so it won't do you any harm to see it in action. Python is multifunctional, for example it can interface with ArcGIS (the software used in the previous lab) to automate workflows. In the last lab we saw how it can be used to construct numerical models and visualise results. In this lab we'll use it to visualise the results of analyses performed on topographic data.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Inside blocks of python code there are comments indicated by lines that start with `#`. These lines are not computer code but rather comments providing information about what the code is doing to help you follow along. Before we get started we need to tell python which tools we want to use (these are called modules):\n"
